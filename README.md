# 🌙 Lunaria

**Lunaria** is a lightweight interpreted language built in Rust.  
It was born as a creative and educational experiment that grew into a real compiler with the ability to write, evaluate and even replicate itself.

> “So far from China, and yet so close to the moon.”  
> — A metaphor for Lunaria’s goal: simple, elegant, and reachable anywhere.

## ✨ Features

- Clean syntax with human-readable structure
- Compile and execute instructions like `console.out`, `fs.out`, and more
- Platform-aware output (Windows `.exe`, Linux/Mac binaries)
- Experimental support for shell commands
- Support for mobile (in progress 🚧)
